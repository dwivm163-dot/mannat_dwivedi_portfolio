                    <p>The object for this assignment was to draw a place described to you in plain language through code. 
                        The partner description I got was: "A strong place in my memory was this particular beach at night. When you try to see beyond the horizon, it's endless. The sky had covered 70% of the atmosphere around me. Littered like little gems were the brightest stars I have ever seen. The wind blows gently, the sand soft and seeps between my toes. The color was that of dusty gold and rusty bronze. Contrasted was the white waves crashing against the sand. Wisps of white clouds become the parallel of the white waves in the sky. Looking back, low level buildings surround the edges of the sand, glowing warm yellow light from within."
                        
                        This assignment made me realise how much we actually rely on visual information to understand the world around us. Trying to create a sketch a place I've never seen from only its discription was tricky but it was interesting to see how we all interpreted the descriptions we were given. This was also my first time working with p5js so I was only able to use simple 2d shapes, layering them to create the whole scene but it was really cool to see how we can use code to create art. Im looking forward to learning how to use more functions and shapes to create how elaborate scenes. </p>
